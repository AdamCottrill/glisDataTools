\description{
Map spatial data in from table in a GLIS template
}
\details{
This function will produce interactive leaflet maps for the
spatial data contained in the FN026, FN026_subspace, FN121, or
FN121_GPS_Tracks tables.  If the table has two coordinates for
each record, the map will present both points connected by a line
segment to represent the association.  Warning are produced if any
of the cordinates are invalid or fall outside the bounds of the t
Great Lakes.  Clicking on the markers will render a pop-up that
will present the SLUG of the object so that it can be found in the
source database.
