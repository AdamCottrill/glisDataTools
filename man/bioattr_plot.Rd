\item dataframe containing basic FN125 data (FLEN,TLEN,
RWT)
}}

\item{species_attributes}{\itemize{
\item single row dataframe created by
subsettting FN012 for the given species and grp.

FLEN, TLEN or RWT}

\description{
Plot Density of FN125 data against FN012 constraints
}
\details{
This function will create plot a density plot for the specified
attribute reported in a template database and superimpose those
values against the constrains in the FN012 table. Individual
observations are presented as a rug plot while the FN012 limits
are presented as vertical lines.  Values outside of these limits
are highlighted.  The function takes an optional argument
(glis_fish) that can be used to provide additional context to
evaluate the data in the in the current project against - this is
particularly helpful for species that are often encountered in
small number in a single project, but may exists in sufficient
numbers in other sources.
