subsettting FN012 for the given species and grp.

\description{
Two pannel plot of Condition Factor
}
\details{
This funciton will produce a two-panel plot showing the
distrubtion of condition factor values reported in a template
database.  The panel on the left will contain a density plot of
the observed condition factors as well as the upper and lower
warning and error values.  Observations outside of those bounds
will be highlighted.  The left plot will show weight vs length,
including curves that represent the bounds of the the upper and
lower warning and error values.
