Validate a project code
}
\details{
A little helper functin that verifies that the provided project
code conforms to fn-2 standards.  Essentially, three numbers or
letters, followed by an underscore, two letters, followed by two
numbers, followed by another underscore, followed by three
alph-numeric characters.  Strings that conform to this pattern
will be considered valid project codes and the function will
return TRUE, otherwise it will return FALSE.
