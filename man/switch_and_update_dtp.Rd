\description{
Standarize daytype encoding
}
\details{
This function will switch the encoding used to indicate week-days
and weekends in a creel.  These were left to the discression of
the project lead, and as a result are not consisten across all
creels.  This is a wrapper function that will switch the day-type
values in the FN023, FN024 and F025 tables, and update the strata
fields in the FN111 and F121 tables.
