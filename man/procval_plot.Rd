\item{src}{Path to the populated template database.  realative
paths are supported. An error will be thrown if the database
cannot be found or is not an accdb file.}

\item{spc}{Three character species code for the species to plot}

\item{grp}{The group of the spc+grp to select. Defaults to '00'}

\item{what}{The bioligical attribute to plot - must be on of
"FLEN", "TLEN", "RWT", "Kflen", or "Ktlen".}

\item an optional dataframe that can be used to
prodive additional biological data for more context.

\description{
Plot Process Validate FN125 data against FN012 constraints
}
\details{
This function will create plots associated with some of the
process validate queries that check biological attributes against
constrains in the FN012 table.  Currently, plots for fork length,
total length, round weight, and condition factor (based on fork or
total length) are supported.  In most cases, the generated plot
includes a density plot showing the distribution of the observed
variable for specified species, and a rug plot illustrating
individual observations.  The plot will also include vertical
lines that illustrate the associated limits from the FN012 table.
Values outside of these limits are highlighted.  The function
takes an optional argument (glis_fish) that can be used to provide
additional context to evaluate data in the current project against
\itemize{
\item this is particularly helpful for species that are often
encountered in small number in a single project.
