\description{
Migrate a assessment project from Nearshore Master to GLIS Assessment Template
}
\details{
This function is the workhorse of the UGLMU assessment project
mapper. It migrates the data for a single project into a
assessment project tempalte database that can then be run throught
process validate and uploaded to assessment project portal.  It
depends on an assocaited ms access file that contains queries to
make most of the transformations.  These queries are parameterized
to accept a prj_cd string, and are all named "get_tablename".
